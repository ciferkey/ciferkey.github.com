A nice little surprise popped up in my RSS feeds today.  [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2011/07/01/giveaway-free-moo-ca.html) has a coupon code BOINGSTICK for some free* stickers, labels or sticker-books from MOO Cards. Now some people complain that this is just a gimmick from Moo Cards to send out emails, but considering the fact that I have already bought business cards from them before and I'm wise enough to turn off emails from them, its not really a problem.

I did manage to snag 52 free* Aperture Science themed stickers. Seems like win win to me.

\*Yes free. Not even shipping and handling.
