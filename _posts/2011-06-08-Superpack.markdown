**OS X Superpack**

I just thought that it was worth mentioning, [StrongInterface](http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/) has the "Scipy Superpack for Mac OSX".  It can be a bit of a pain getting Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib setup.  This nifty little script will do all the heavy lifting for you.
