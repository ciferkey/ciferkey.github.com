One excellent perk of finally graduating high school is that I can now finally make it to some [Providence Geek Nights](http://providencegeeks.org/) (school commitments always seemed to conflict).  Unfortunately they take August off so there will not be one next month, but after that they host these events once a month, usually on a mid-month Wednesday, from 5:30 to 8:00 at [AS220](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=14203619864685607776&q=as220&hl=en&sll=41.707528,-71.434128&sspn=0.27429,0.043628&ie=UTF8&ll=41.891544,-71.880112&spn=0,0&t=h&z=11) in Providence (which happens to be two blocks down from where I work).  People usually socialize for the first hour (the food is excellent) and around 6:30 the special guest for the night gives a presentation.

This month Moveable code gave an excellent discussion on their adventures as a startup that suffered from several pivots, a gatekeeper market, being able to see innovation before anyone else was willing to believe them long enough to actually invest in them. From the Providence Geeks site:

> "[MoveableCode](http://moveablecode.com/) is building a 21st century toy company. The Bristol-based startup creates and sells play and entertainment products built on Social Shareability, Location, and Mobile technology – an approach and technique they call SoLoMo Play. At the July Geek Dinner, CEO Nick Napp and Chief Play Officer Kevin Mowrer will tell the MoveableCode story – where they’ve been and where they’re headed (yes, there’s a “pivot” in there!). Nick and Kevin have an silly amount of industry experience and expertise, having served as a Sony-Ericsson opportunity scout and Hasbro SVP for R&D, respectively."

It was an excellent night, with great food (the grilled cheese at AS220 is wonderful) and I managed to snag a photo of this lovely bit of culture written on the wall in the bathroom.  Nerd points to anyone who knows what this phrase is from.

Providence Geek's added an [interview](http://www.providencegeeks.com/2011/08/02/providence-geeks-video-podcast-nick-napp-and-kevin-mowrer-of-moveablecode/) with the master minds behind MoveableCode.
