I'm a big fan of 8bit music. Not all chip tunes are created equal though. Some really stand out and show that a lot of care has been put into their design.  Music quality is also very import to me. Thats why I love [bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/).  They have quite the collection of chiptunes, many of which are free, all of which are available in lossless form. Some of my favorites are:

 * [3 Flavors of 8bit](http://childhoodchords.bandcamp.com/album/3-flavors-of-8bit) by [Dainumo](http://www.last.fm/music/Dainumo), [Jeesh](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeesh), and [P SUS](http://www.last.fm/music/p.sus)
 * [ReMixes](http://insertrupee.halc9bit.com/) by Insert Rupee

**Bonus** If you own Portal 2 you can extract the wave file for the co-op ending song, [Robots FTW](http://www.last.fm/music/Valve/_/Robots+FTW):

On a OS X use [Source Fangler](http://www.markdouma.com/sourcefinagler/), open

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/portal\ 2/portal2/pak01_dir.vpk

then go to sound -> music -> portal2_robots_ftw.wav 

On a Windows use [GCFScrape](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=26), open

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\portal 2\portal2\pak01_dir.vpk

then go to sound -> music -> portal2_robots_ftw.wav 

(portal2_want_you_gone.wav is the single player ending song [Want You Gone](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonathan+Coulton/_/Want+You+Gone) by Jonathan Coulton (not 8bit)). 

You can play it as is or convert it to flac.
