There is a sandwich place near my work that I visit frequently for lunch. They have an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/davesfreshpasta/) where they post their daily specials menu which is convenient since I can see what the specials are before heading over. However in some form of twisted sloath I wanted to be directly told whenever there was a special menu update. Thus Soup Bot was born.

[Source is available](https://gitlab.com/ciferkey/soup-bot)

The goal was simple: check for new posts on Instagram and if the new post is a specials board (and not some other photo) send a message over Slack. The anticipated plan was:
1. Scrape all the posted images from the Instagram profile @davesfreshpasta and seperate images of the soupboard from the non-soupboard
2. Retrain a Tensorflow image classifier to learn the new categories of Soup and Not Soup.
3. Create a script that will
** Check for new posts and classify them.
** If the new post is Soup, send a message to slack
5. Find a cheap and simple way to deploy the whole thing (I ended up going with AWS Lambda)
4. Get soup on the days where there are specials that I like.

## Scraping the Training Corpus
In the beging I was just toying with the idea of soup bot so rather than script the process of downloading all the images I used a [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downloader-for-instagram/olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe?hl=en) to download all ~7500 images from their Instagram profile and then sorted them by hand. This seemed reason at the time since it was a one time process. Classification results for this initial corpus have seemed good enough so far that I'm not sure if I will ever end up downloading new images and retraining.

Here is an example of the soup special board:

## Classification
In order to tell which photos were soup menus and which were not (to avoid sending messages that are not soup menus) I need to train an image classifier. Thankfully Tensorflow has a [precanned retraining script](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining) with great documentation for retraining an existing ImageNet classier. After an original test with the default retraining setting I switched from using the regular ImageNet classifier to a MobileNet classifier to cut operating costs. I dubbed it the the Mobile Soup classifier. It resulted in a cool savings of:
* ~10x reduction model size. 85mb to 8.9mb (important since AWS Lambda constrains the size of your deployment bundle)
* ~2x increase run time speed. cProfile in Pycharm showed a ~6800ms down to ~3100ms for the total runtime of the tensorflow method calls.
* ~3x reduction memory usage (TBH this is mostly eyeballed...)
* a relatively small loss in accuracy (that I have not put the time in to quantify). Luckily I only need to differentiate between two classes of images so accuracy started off very good (positive classifications are typically greater than 98%).


## The Script
Oddly enough two weeks before I started development Instagram [deprecated the official APIs methods](https://www.instagram.com/developer/changelog/) I could have used. Luckily nature finds a way and there are existing libraries like [Instalooter](https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter) that work off scraping pages rather than using the official APIs. The library makes its easy to fetch posts over a specific time range. 

I keep track of the fetched images and the classifications using a standard setup with [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). Local testing runs against a SQLite database. The Lambda methods on AWS uses a PostgreSQL RDS instance (the tiniest one they have).

Final part was Slack integration. Originally I was going to go with a whole subscription model where people could ask to receive updates and then be notified with private messages but a coworker pointed out I could just have a channel that the updates get posted to which people could subscribe (and thats much easier to do). I used the library [Slacker](https://github.com/os/slacker) to handle the integration.

## Deploying
To save time with deploying I went with [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) to ease configuring AWS lambda. Additionally since the dependencies are quite large (we need to include tensorflow and all its dependencies) and need to be included in the deployed bundle I used the [Serverless Python Requirements](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements) plugin to help with bundling and compressing the dependencies (especially useful for getting the correct tensorflow/numpy binaries in the bundle). The main complications I ran into when setting up AWS were around VPC configuration but others before me have [resolved the issues before](https://gist.github.com/reggi/dc5f2620b7b4f515e68e46255ac042a7).

Finally CloudWatch was used to schedule events to kick off the lambda function, and to [start and stop the RDS instance](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1190194/Start-Stop-RDS-instances-on-schedule) in order to reduce costs. 

**Update 6/3/2018:**

So it turns out NAT Gateways are quite pricey (~$30 a month). It seems [other people have come to this realization as well](https://hackernoon.com/dealing-with-an-aws-billing-surprise-beware-the-defaults-d8a95f6635a2). As an alternative I've replaced the NAT Gateway with a scheduled NAT Instance on EC2 using the images provided by AWS. Finally for additional cost savings I'm using [another set of scheduled lambdas](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/start-stop-lambda-cloudwatch/) to start and stop the EC2 instance.

**Update 6/30/2018:**

Another caveat I found while monitoring the billing dashboard: AWS will not charge you for an Elastic IP associated with a running EC2 instance. However if you keep and EIP associated with a stopped EC2 instance then you will be charged (around $3 a month) to incentive people not to horde IP addreses. [Details on EIP billing works](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elastic-ip-charges/).

Rather than creating a third set of lambdas to handle the allocation/association and deallocation/disassociation I instead dropped the original lambdas and created a [new single Python 3.6 lambda](https://gitlab.com/ciferkey/soup-bot/blob/master/provision.py) to handle starting up and shuting down for the main lambda. Additionally I started the process of moving all the informal AWS configuration I had manually configured into the serverless configuration.

## Conclusion
So in the end was [it](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [worth](https://xkcd.com/1319/) [it](https://xkcd.com/1445/)? Probably not. Was it enjoyable? Certainly.
