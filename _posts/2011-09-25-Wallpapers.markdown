I love curating my wallpaper collection.  A few are ones I have made myself, but most of them have been collected from the far reaches of the internet. The ones I have made are:

I made this image based on [XKCD Comic #303](http://xkcd.com/303/) but edited it to apply to my high school communications class.

![Flagrant System Error](https://photos-2.dropbox.com/i/o/APVdbjf_sfHllxNsb6DEi9tfcqj_r7LbK-CVatG1J8U/1667359/1317096000/356d69b)
This was based off a screen shot I found of [Strongbad Email #118 "Virus"](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail118.html). I added extra space around it to fix my desktop resolution.

![Studio Ghibli](https://photos-6.dropbox.com/i/o/PLdxrho37OYfyNYrWT8bMHLQppKEQGz7RiIBzis1ThU/1667359/1317096000/84f511d)
