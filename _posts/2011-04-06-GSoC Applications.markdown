It’s been an incredibly interesting experience working on my applications for the Google Summer of Code. I will be sending in my applications to four projects: Django, Learning Unlimited, Mailman and Melange. I don't know how many people my age usually apply, but I am guessing that it’s a relatively small percentage.  In the end, even if I am not accepted into any of the projects I will still have learned quite a lot. I was able to work on my resume building skill.  I was able to work on having discussions with open source communities.  I was able to look into the code bases of many projects. Above all I was able to glean enough experience that I am positive I will get in next year.
Keeping my fingers crossed.
