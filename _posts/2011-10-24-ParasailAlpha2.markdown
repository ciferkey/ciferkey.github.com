Alpha 0.2 of Parasail has been [released](http://parasail-programming-language.blogspot.com/2011/10/alpha-release-02-of-parasail-compiler.html).  I'm pretty excited about trying this language out.  Parasail is a "a new programming language designed to allow productive development of parallel, high-integrity (safety-critical, high-security) software systems. the language is tentatively named "parasail" for parallel, specification and implementation language."  I love looking at all the different approaches to parallelism, so this is definitely going to be fun to play with.
