Haskell is tough, and I love that about it. It forces you to take your time, in order to produce reliable code.  I may just convert from being a Pythonista to Haskellism.  However if I am ever going to get anything worth while made with it, I'm going to need to reach a state of Haskell Nirvana.  I want to know every nuance of the language from top to bottom.  As such, I am maintaining a list of the sources that I have found most helpful, for those who may wish to walk down the path of zen as well.
