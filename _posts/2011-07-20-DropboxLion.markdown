title: Using Dropbox on OS X Lion

If anyone just recently upgraded to OS X Lion (or has been running the Developer Preview \*Cough Cough\*) they may have found Dropbox works, but lacks finder integration.  To fix this uninstall it and install this [developer release](http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=41644&replies=7).

It seems to be quite stable but keep in mind that it is a pre-release.
