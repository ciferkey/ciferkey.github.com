One excellent perk of finally graduating high school is that I can now finally make it to some [Providence Geek Nights](http://providencegeeks.org/) (school commitments always seemed to conflict).  Unfortunately they take August off so there will not be one next month, but after that they host these events once a month, usually on a mid-month wednesday, from 5:30 to 8:00 at AS220 in Providence (which happens to be two blocks down from where I work).
