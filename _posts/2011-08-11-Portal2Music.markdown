I'm a pretty big fan of Portal and Portal 2.  As such I was sucked into the whole pre-release ARG. I figure that if I spent all that money on the Potato sack, I might as well get some free music along with the game. Luckily there is an immense amount of sound files in the game.  Most of them are ambient noise and sound effects but you can get the co-op ending song [Robots FTW](http://www.last.fm/music/Valve/_/Robots+FTW), and the the single player ending song [Want You Gone](http://www.last.fm/music/Jonathan+Coulton/_/Want+You+Gone) by Jonathan Coulton.

On a OS X use [Source Fangler](http://www.markdouma.com/sourcefinagler/), open

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/portal\ 2/portal2/pak01_dir.vpk

On a Windows use [GCFScrape](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=26), open

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\portal 2\portal2\pak01_dir.vpk

For Robots FTW go to sound -> music -> portal2_robots_ftw.wav 

For Want You Gone go to sound -> music -> portal2_robots_ftw.wav 


They're both lossless and you can play them as is or convert it to flac.

**Bonus**
Valve has released part 1 and part 2 (part 3 is coming) of the [Official Soundtrack](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/music.php) for free! The songs above aren't
